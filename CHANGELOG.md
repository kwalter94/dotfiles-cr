# dotrepo CHANGELOG

This document tracks all changes to application between versions.
Versioning follows the [semver](https://semver.org) guidelines. In short
versions follow the following format `major.minor.patch`. Bug fixes
increment the patch value, new features that aren't user interface breaking
increment raise the minor value, and feature additions that alter the
user interface result in a major increment. The major may also be incremented
in cases where there were a lot of new feature additions.

Changes are categorised into a number of categories namely:

- Added
- Fixed
- Removed
- Deprecated

`Added` tracks all new additions. `Fixed` tracks all bug fixes. `Removed`
tracks all removals that were previosly scheduled for removal. `Deprecated`
tracks all pending removals.
